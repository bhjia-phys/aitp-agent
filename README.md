## The Idea

Hakimi is intentionally a little playful. The name carries the lightness of "Hakimi" and the curiosity of a small exploration spacecraft with cat-ear fins: not a cold oracle, not a giant black box, but a companion for entering unknown physics problems with care, memory, and evidence.

The serious part is the mission. Hakimi is built for theoretical physics work where a conversation can touch papers, derivations, code, benchmarks, failed runs, conventions, and long-lived research memory. The agent should not merely answer from a prompt. It should help keep the research state coherent.

## Why This Exists

Hakimi is not a notebook bolted onto a coding agent. It is a runtime-native fork of [MoonshotAI/kimi-code](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code): the terminal loop, tools, sessions, skills, MCP, subagents, records/replay, permissions, OAuth path, and package shape remain Kimi Code-compatible where compatibility matters. The theoretical-physics system is inserted into the runtime itself through `.hakimi` research files, legacy `.aitp` compatibility files, `packages/agent-core`, turn-loop context injection, tool exposure, records, replay, and model-facing research tools.

That means a research action can search literature, inspect code, prepare patches, submit or normalize external job receipts, capture evidence, and return to the correct WorkFrame without mixing unrelated topics. The goal is simple to say and hard to do: each research thread should remember what it knows, what it assumes, what evidence supports it, what remains unverified, and which tools produced the trail.

</p>

## What Works Today

- `hakimi` is the only CLI command installed by this package, so it does not overwrite a separate Kimi Code `kimi` command.
- The TUI welcome screen uses the Hakimi pixel spacecraft identity and physics research copy.
- WorkFrames keep active research topics scoped by domain, topic, assumptions, conventions, context pack, and trust state.
- Domain packs, workflow recipes, physics memory, evals, action bindings, and tool inventories can be loaded from file-backed `.hakimi` fixtures, with legacy `.aitp` fixtures still scanned for compatibility.
- New topics do not require hand-written packs up front: Hakimi now registers a built-in generic theoretical-physics profile, workflow recipes, process-memory capsules, and a smoke eval by default, then falls back to that scaffold when a WorkFrame has no dedicated pack.
- AITP v5 `process_graph_slice` payloads can be parsed and locally compiled into research-context reminders, open-obligation summaries, trust-boundary warnings, and recommended `ResearchAction` ids without copying the AITP graph into Hakimi as truth.
- AITP `exploratory_records` inside a process graph slice now compile into first-class moments for question decomposition, relation-path brainstorming, source/backtrace continuity, original-question drift audit, and `aitp.record_exploratory_record`.
- AITP `source_asset` nodes and `source_asset_ids` now compile into source-backtrace reminders, so raw papers, lectures, notes, code snapshots, datasets, and generated artifacts stay canonical in `.aitp` while Hakimi keeps only bounded WorkFrame context.
- AITP moment-policy metadata now flows into Hakimi action bindings: timing and trust-boundary hints tell the model when to brainstorm before using a relation, backtrace before using a source as support, record a formed checkpoint, or request a human checkpoint before trust changes.
- Hakimi now has a narrow AITP CLI bridge for `aitp-v5 graph slice` and `aitp-v5 exploration record`, plus a controller-side process graph provider that can fetch an AITP slice before research-context injection when a WorkFrame carries explicit `aitp:session:<id>` scope. The bridge executes only a configured AITP command with structured args and keeps `.aitp` as the canonical record store.
- Research actions can run in-process graph queries, benchmark adapters, formalization blueprint exports, and external job receipt normalization.
- Literature search, code patch preparation, and external benchmark workflows are orchestrated through native Kimi tools rather than being executed inside `ResearchAction` itself.
- Evidence can be written to the research ledger, reread only inside matching WorkFrame scope, compiled into graph candidates, and checked by harness/final-gate logic.
- Full context compaction is now research-aware: when WorkFrames are open, Hakimi injects and stores a runtime-generated `Hakimi Research State` block with the initial research question, domain/topic, ContextPack/domain pack, physics memory ids, evidence refs, action attempts/outcomes, raw primitive-tool escapes, open obligations, and next steps. Separate WorkFrames stay separated in the compacted summary.

## Architecture Layers

Hakimi is organized around six research-runtime layers.

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Skills | Procedural memory: how the agent should work, such as derivation checks, formula-to-code debugging, and LibRPA run preparation. |
| Physics memory capsules | Semantic memory: claims with scope, assumptions, provenance, dependency edges, reliability state, and expansion handles. |
| Research ledger | Source-backed events from real sessions before they are trusted as reusable memory. |
| Compiler and graph | A knowledge compiler that preserves dependencies, contradiction markers, validation status, and failure conditions. |
| Research actions | Auditable work units such as convention checks, graph expansion, formula-code mapping, benchmark validation, and harness generation. |
| AITP native adapter | A boundary layer that consumes AITP typed process graph slices as canonical local research-process context, then compiles them into Hakimi turn-local reminders and action recommendations. |

`WorkFrame` is the live research problem state tying these layers together. It tracks the active domain, topic, goal, assumptions, conventions, context pack, evidence, obligations, and final-gate status. Blocking obligations prevent a result from being treated as validated memory.

This matters most when the conversation is compacted. Ordinary chat history can be shortened, but the runtime state for each open WorkFrame is rendered into the compaction request and then appended deterministically to the stored compaction summary. For real research topics, open a WorkFrame early; that makes the initial question, physics memory, current derivation/code progress, failed attempts, and next obligations recoverable after automatic compaction and session replay.

## AITP Boundary

The long-term architecture treats `.aitp` as the host-agnostic canonical typed
research graph and source-asset store. Hakimi should be its most native reader,
not a second authority that reimplements the same research ledger schema.

The first adapter slices are now implemented at the library/context/runtime
boundary:
Hakimi accepts an AITP `process_graph_slice`, normalizes current v5 field names,
preserves the orientation-only boundary, and compiles it into ContextPack lines,
diagnostics, source-asset reminders, moment-policy timing/trust-boundary hints,
and native `ResearchActionBinding` recommendations. AITP owns source asset identity, hashes, version anchors, and
raw asset provenance; Hakimi only compiles the currently relevant source asset
ids into a bounded WorkFrame prompt. Hakimi also has a narrow CLI bridge and
optional WorkFrame-scoped provider for `aitp-v5 graph slice`, plus a write
bridge for `aitp-v5 exploration record`. The default scope resolver only reads
AITP when the WorkFrame explicitly carries refs such as `aitp:session:<id>` and
`aitp:claim:<id>`, so Hakimi does not guess which local graph belongs to a
research turn.

The remaining runtime work is policy, not schema: the turn loop can now fetch a
slice through a provider, but it still needs richer moment policy for when a
brainstorming or backtrace step has become formed enough to record, and when a
trust boundary requires stricter validation or a human checkpoint.

## Relationship To Upstream

Hakimi remains close to upstream Kimi Code on purpose. The SDK/OAuth imports stay compatible where useful, while Hakimi uses its own `.hakimi` user/project config roots by default so model, MCP, session, and runtime state do not collide with a separate Kimi Code install. The user-facing product is `Hakimi`, the npm package is `@bhjia-phys/hakimi`, and the primary executable is `hakimi`. Hakimi releases use an independent semver line, currently `0.13.0`, instead of mirroring upstream Kimi Code tags. This is a native fork, not an external wrapper.

Codex and ForgeCode are references rather than dependencies: Codex informs tool exposure, structured tool outputs, and action traces; ForgeCode informs harness and repeatable eval workflows.

## Roadmap

### 0.0.1: Physics Memory Vertical Slice

Build the first runtime-native memory path inside `packages/agent-core`:

- add `physics-memory` types, parser, scanner, registry, compiler, and exports;
- add a model-invocable `PhysicsMemory` builtin tool;
- support `list_domains`, `list_capsules`, `load_capsule`, and `compile_context`;
- keep physics memory parallel to skills rather than embedding it inside skills;
- gate the feature behind an experimental flag;
- prove the shape with a narrow LibRPA fixture set.

The 0.0.1 schema should already reserve fields for graph references, expansion handles, required checks, and action affordances so the later research-action layer has a stable target.

### 0.0.2: Research Ledger And ActionAlgebra

- add a `research-ledger` subsystem that scans `.aitp/research-ledger` and stores source-backed research events separately from trusted physics memory;
- add compile proposals from ledger events into candidate capsules, graph refs, obligations, and harness candidates;
- extend `ResearchActionRegistry` into an ActionAlgebra with phases, preconditions, effects, generated obligations, validators, and primitive tool attribution;
- add `WorkFrame`, `ResearchObligation`, and `ValidationScheduler` foundations;
- expose `ResearchLedger` and `ResearchAction` model tools behind experimental flags;
- coordinate Kimi primitive tools, Codex-style lifecycle ideas, and ForgeCode-style harness boundaries without replacing Kimi's tool manager.

### 0.0.3: Thin Base Runtime Spine

Add the smallest Codex-inspired reliability layer needed for AITP capture:

- primitive tool lifecycle envelopes;
- action/workframe attribution for tool calls;
- result status and artifact refs;
- diff/output capture boundaries;
- interruption/background awareness where needed.

This slice should not port Codex or rewrite Kimi's tool manager.

### 0.0.4: LedgerWriter And Controlled Capture

- add schema-checked `ResearchLedger.write_event`;
- write deterministic `.aitp/research-ledger/<topic>/events/*.md` files;
- capture only high-value source, git diff, benchmark, and failure observations at first;
- keep long outputs as artifact refs instead of ledger noise.

### 0.0.5: WorkFrame And ResearchAction Call Trace

- make WorkFrame an active session context;
- support opening, switching, listing, and closing WorkFrames;
- connect ResearchAction calls to primitive tool calls and ledger events;
- generate obligations from action effects;
- preserve domain isolation across simultaneous research frames.

### 0.0.6: LibRPA Micro Vertical Slice

Prove the runtime spine on a narrow computational-physics workflow:

```text
formula capsule
-> code mapping
-> git diff / implementation trace
-> smoke benchmark
-> intermediate observable check
-> failure mode or validated memory update
-> harness regression case
```

### 0.0.7: Capsule Boundary Compiler

- compile locally self-consistent derivation/code blocks into candidate capsules;
- keep micro reasoning lightweight;
- use capsule boundaries only when local blocks connect to memory, graph, final answers, or other blocks.

### 0.0.8: PhysicsDirectionEngine And Lenses

- add applicability-gated physics lenses rather than keyword triggers;
- start with `topological-order/fqhe-cs` and `librpa/head-wing` domain packs;
- include a charge-flux quantization lens that distinguishes external electromagnetic flux, emergent Chern-Simons flux, and quasiparticle AB flux periods.

### 0.0.9: EscalationPolicy And Final Gate

- keep simple questions light;
- escalate code edits, benchmark work, promotion, and high-risk theory claims;
- prevent final answers from claiming validated status while blocking obligations remain open.

### 0.1: Harness And Eval Runner

- convert failed or inconclusive action traces into reviewable harness candidates;
- promote confirmed candidates into deterministic eval cases;
- add end-to-end evals for FQHE/CS reasoning and LibRPA head-wing workflows.

### 0.2: FQHE/CS Theory Vertical Slice

Close the first formal-theory loop with capsules, derivation blocks, physics lenses, convention checks, and final-answer status around Laughlin wavefunctions, flux insertion, charge-flux quantization, Chern-Simons effective theory, and K-matrix response.

## Current Status

- Upstream parity with `MoonshotAI/kimi-code:main` was refreshed on 2026-06-03 and merged through commit `6a22523` (`fix: simplify goal budget schema and fix output caps (#365)`), preserving the AITP runtime integrations.
- `hakimi --version` now follows Hakimi's own CLI/package release line. The current local package version is `0.13.0`; upstream Kimi Code release numbers are treated as sync points, not Hakimi release numbers.
- The AITP Agent 0.0.1 physics-memory vertical slice is implemented and now starts enabled in Hakimi unless `KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_PHYSICS_MEMORY=0` is set.
- `packages/agent-core` now includes physics-memory types, parser, scanner, registry, compiler, session scanning, append-only records, a model-invocable `PhysicsMemory` builtin tool, LibRPA fixture capsules, and a foundational `ResearchActionRegistry`.
- Windows baseline failures in the broader `agent-core` suite have been resolved; see [AITP Agent 0.0.1 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.1-audit.md).
- The 0.0.2 foundation is implemented: `research-ledger` types/parser/scanner/registry/compiler, session scanning, append-only records, `ResearchLedger` tool, ActionAlgebra types, default research actions, scheduler, `ResearchAction` tool, raw-tool escape records, and harness candidate conversion. See [AITP Agent 0.0.2 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.2-audit.md).
- 0.0.3 has started with the thin primitive tool lifecycle spine: real loop-level tool calls now emit `tool_lifecycle.started` and `tool_lifecycle.completed` records with status, bounded summaries, timing, cwd, and future WorkFrame/ResearchAction attribution slots. See [AITP Agent 0.0.3 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.3-audit.md).
- 0.0.4 has started with schema-checked `ResearchLedger.write_event` and controlled `capture_event`: compact source-backed events can be written to deterministic `.aitp/research-ledger/<topic>/events/*.md` paths, registered immediately, audited through `research_ledger.event_written`, and filtered through source/git-diff/benchmark/failure capture policy. See [AITP Agent 0.0.4 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.4-audit.md).
- 0.0.5 has started with active WorkFrame runtime state and ResearchAction call trace: `ResearchAction` can open/switch/list/close WorkFrames, start/finish action calls, replay both, attach ledger event ids to action results, and primitive tool lifecycle records now carry active `workFrameId` and `actionCallId`. See [AITP Agent 0.0.5 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.5-audit.md).
- 0.0.6 has started with a LibRPA head-wing micro vertical slice: universal code/benchmark actions bound to LibRPA workflow intent, a CI-safe head-wing smoke benchmark stand-in, scheduler expectations, controlled failure capture, and harness candidate conversion. See [AITP Agent 0.0.6 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.6-audit.md).
- 0.0.7 has started with a capsule boundary compiler: locally self-contained `ResearchBlock` objects can compile into unpromoted `PhysicsCapsule` candidates with assumptions, conventions, source refs, open questions, and required checks preserved. See [AITP Agent 0.0.7 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.7-audit.md).
- 0.0.8 has started with PhysicsDirectionEngine and applicability-gated lenses: FQHE/CS charge-flux quantization and LibRPA head-wing formula-code mapping can now be recommended, rejected, and audited with caveats, guiding questions, required checks, and structured ResearchAction bindings. See [AITP Agent 0.0.8 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.8-audit.md).
- 0.0.9 has started with EscalationPolicy and Final Gate: simple physics questions remain lightweight, code/benchmark/high-risk theory/promotion work escalates into required runtime controls, and validated final claims are downgraded or blocked while blocking obligations remain open. See [AITP Agent 0.0.9 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.9-audit.md).
- 0.1 has started with Harness and Eval Runner: failed/inconclusive action traces can become deterministic eval cases, and eval runs can check action sequence, action outcomes, evidence refs, and required checks. See [AITP Agent 0.1 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.1-audit.md).
- 0.2 has started with an executable FQHE/CS theory vertical slice: Laughlin wavefunction, flux insertion, Abelian CS action, and K-matrix response blocks compile into candidate capsules, pass through charge-flux lens/convention checks, produce an eval case, and reach the final gate. See [AITP Agent 0.2 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2-audit.md).
- 0.2.1 upstream sync guardrail has configured a local `upstream` remote for Kimi Code; a later retry successfully merged `upstream/main` at `7ffb5dd` while preserving AITP runtime extensions. See [Upstream Sync 2026-06-02](docs/internal/upstream-sync-2026-06-02.md).
- 0.2.2 has refactored research actions toward universal ids plus structured `ResearchActionBinding`: FQHE/CS charge-flux checks now bind `validate.check_convention` with a charge-flux `checkId`, and LibRPA head-wing benchmark work now binds `benchmark.run_minimal_case` with a LibRPA adapter id. See [AITP Agent 0.2.2 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2.2-audit.md).
- 0.2.3 has added file-backed `DomainProfile` and `WorkflowRecipe` registries behind `KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_DOMAIN_PROFILE` and `KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_WORKFLOW_RECIPE`, scanning `.aitp/domain-profiles` and `.aitp/workflow-recipes` into `agent.domainProfiles` and `agent.workflowRecipes`. See [AITP Agent 0.2.3 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2.3-audit.md).
- 0.2.5 has added the first WorkFrame ContextPack orchestrator: active WorkFrames can compile bounded `ResearchContextPack` summaries from DomainProfile, WorkflowRecipe, PhysicsMemory, ResearchLedger, and action bindings, then attach the pack id back to the WorkFrame for replay and audit. See [AITP Agent 0.2.5 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2.5-audit.md).
- 0.2.6 has started closing the turn loop: prompt-sensitive WorkFrame reuse/switching now runs inside the injection cycle, bounded `ResearchContextPack` summaries can be recompiled for the inferred active frame, and a compact AITP research-context reminder can enter the model-facing context before a research step. See [AITP Agent 0.2.6 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2.6-audit.md).
- 0.2.7 has started dynamic tool exposure: once a research turn has a bounded `ResearchContextPack`, the runtime can apply a temporary managed-tool overlay so theory-oriented turns keep semantic research tools visible while code-oriented turns can additionally expose `Bash` / `Write` / `Edit`. See [AITP Agent 0.2.7 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2.7-audit.md).
- 0.2.8 has started controlled auto-capture from real work: `tool_lifecycle.completed` can now classify real tool outcomes against the active `WorkFrame`, write compact git-diff / benchmark / failure / source-excerpt evidence into `.aitp/research-ledger`, and record explicit skip reasons for low-value tool noise. See [AITP Agent 0.2.8 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2.8-audit.md).
- 0.2.9 has started graph-aware memory compilation: ledger events can now compile into typed graph candidates with provenance checks, dependency diagnostics, assumption traces, and contradiction warnings for incompatible conventions. These outputs remain candidate-level rather than silently becoming canonical memory. See [AITP Agent 0.2.9 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2.9-audit.md).
- 0.3.0 has started the promotion pipeline and trust-ladder gate: graph candidates can now be promoted only through an explicit `PhysicsPromotionPacket` with source refs, scope, validation refs, and formalization checkpoint requirements enforced. Promoted capsules keep trust metadata instead of discarding the promotion path. See [AITP Agent 0.3.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.3.0-audit.md).
- 0.3.1 has started final-gate lifecycle integration: when a research turn tries to end while the active `WorkFrame` still fails the final gate, the runtime now injects one concise final-gate continuation message and forces one more model step so the answer can downgrade itself instead of quietly overclaiming completion. See [AITP Agent 0.3.1 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.3.1-audit.md).
- 0.4.0 has started Harness V2: file-backed research eval cases under `.aitp/evals` can now parse into `ResearchEvalCase`, load through `agent.researchHarness` by default in Hakimi, check action bindings/evidence/final status/forbidden claims, and write failed or inconclusive harness candidates back as deterministic eval files. This slice also scopes final-gate evidence to the active WorkFrame so unrelated prior evidence cannot satisfy validated status. See [AITP Agent 0.4.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.4.0-audit.md).
- 0.5.0 has started the real LibRPA file-backed vertical: `adapter.librpa.head-wing-smoke` is now a first-class benchmark adapter contract, and the repo includes LibRPA `.aitp` domain profile, workflow recipe, physics-memory capsules, and eval fixtures that load through an isolated session and close the context/eval/final-gate loop. See [AITP Agent 0.5.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.5.0-audit.md).
- 0.6.0 has started the FQHE/CS V2 file-backed theory vertical: Laughlin wavefunction, flux insertion, Abelian CS response, K-matrix response, known-limit checks, and flux-identity failure modes now live in `.aitp` fixtures and pass isolated-session context/eval tests without LibRPA leakage. See [AITP Agent 0.6.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.6.0-audit.md).
- 0.7.0 has started bridge-gated multi-domain isolation: `Bridge` capsules can now explicitly authorize named cross-domain capsules, default FQHE/LibRPA context packs stay separate, and `bridgePolicy: deny` records cross-domain denial diagnostics. See [AITP Agent 0.7.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.7.0-audit.md).
- 0.8.0 has started the graph kernel and query semantics lane: `physics-graph` can build a graph from physics memory, expand neighborhoods and dependency closure, run bridge-policy-aware path search, and query contradiction edges. See [AITP Agent 0.8.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.8.0-audit.md).
- 0.9.0 has started the formalization bridge: `formalization` can identify definitions, assumptions, formulas, lemmas, and theorem-like graph nodes as conservative formalization contracts and export a blueprint-like dependency graph without claiming proof-assistant verification. See [AITP Agent 0.9.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.9.0-audit.md).
- 0.10.0 has started closing the executor gap: `ResearchAction` can now run registered in-process benchmark adapters, physics-graph queries, and formalization-blueprint exports directly through the model-facing tool while preserving primitive shell/git/web attribution boundaries. Harness eval writeback can also namespace candidate eval files by session id so parallel sessions do not collide on the same failure trace. See [AITP Agent 0.10.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.10.0-audit.md).
- 0.11.0 has started primitive tool plan templates and live native-tool orchestration: every default `ResearchAction` can now render an auditable native-tool plan, with first-class actions for literature search, scoped patch preparation, and external benchmark job submission. Runtime tool exposure now reads action bindings, activates the native Kimi tools required by those templates through a turn-scoped Kimi tool builder, and replays topic-scoped overlays/evidence attribution without cross-session leakage while `ResearchAction` still does not execute shell, git, web, MCP, or HPC work itself. The live turn coverage now exercises source search, code patching, and external job submission through native `WebSearch`/`FetchURL`, `Read`/`Edit`, `Bash`, and `ResearchLedger.capture_event` call attribution, writes durable source/code/job event files, emits `research_ledger.event_written`, and feeds `ledger:event...` ids back into `ResearchAction.finish_action_call.evidence_refs`. See [AITP Agent 0.11.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.11.0-audit.md).
- 0.11.1 has added the first external job submission adapter contract: `adapter.external.job-submission` normalizes scheduler/MCP/HPC/manual job receipts into `BenchmarkAdapterRunResult` for `benchmark.submit_external_job` without executing the scheduler inside `ResearchAction`. Primitive plans now include an adapter-normalization step after native submission and before ledger/action recording. See [AITP Agent 0.11.1 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.11.1-audit.md).
- 0.11.2 has added WorkFrame-scoped evidence inspection to `ResearchAction`: the model can list recent evidence refs for the active or explicit frame and load a `ledger:event...` body only when its ledger metadata matches the frame's domain/topic scope. Loading an event records `research_ledger.event_loaded`, and cross-topic/domain loads fail before rendering the body. See [AITP Agent 0.11.2 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.11.2-audit.md).
- 0.11.3 has made the external-job receipt lane more native-tool friendly: `adapter.external.job-submission` can now infer job ids from common scheduler outputs such as SLURM, LSF, SGE, and PBS/qsub receipts while refusing arbitrary shell output. This lets native Bash/MCP/remote-runner submissions feed the adapter with `schedulerOutput` alone when the receipt format is clear. See [AITP Agent 0.11.3 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.11.3-audit.md).
- 0.12.0 has added a file-backed `DomainPackManifest` runtime summary: `ResearchContextPack` now carries the profile/workflow/memory/eval/action/tool inventory for its domain, context reminders and `ResearchAction` rendering expose that manifest, and runtime tool exposure no longer opens code tools just because the domain is LibRPA. Code-capable tools now come from file-backed workflow `required_tools`, DomainPack action ids, or universal action primitive plans. FQHE/CS and LibRPA fixture tests assert that evals, capsules, and tool exposure remain isolated unless an explicit bridge capsule is present. See [AITP Agent 0.12.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.12.0-audit.md).
- 0.12.1 has tightened the native research runtime: `ResearchAction.inspect_domain_pack` can inspect the active or explicit ContextPack's DomainPack manifest, raw primitive tools used inside an active WorkFrame without an active `ResearchAction` call now emit `research_action.raw_tool_escape` with `workFrameId` and a suggested follow-up action, and older hardcoded vertical exports are marked compatibility-only in favor of file-backed `.aitp` domain packs.
- The runtime roadmap through 0.12.1 is now implemented as a file-backed, graph-aware, bridge-gated, audited baseline with deterministic research executors for the graph, benchmark, formalization, and external-job receipt lanes plus native-tool orchestration for literature, code, and external benchmark workflows. Topic packs now have manifest-level profile/workflow/memory/eval/action/tool summaries, primitive tool call attribution, durable ledger evidence references, scoped evidence reread from the semantic action layer, conservative native scheduler receipt inference, and WorkFrame-scoped recovery records for raw primitive tool escapes.
- 0.12.2 makes the Hakimi research runtime default-on: `physics-memory`, `research-ledger`, `research-action`, `domain-profile`, `workflow-recipe`, `research-harness`, and `/goal` now start enabled unless explicitly set to `0`. Empty/new theoretical-physics topics get a built-in `theoretical-physics/general` process scaffold with literature search, source capture, derivation, validation, memory/eval, code-mapping, patch, benchmark, and external-job action bindings. Dedicated `.aitp` packs still take priority when present.
- 0.12.3 makes full context compaction research-aware: `FullCompaction` now renders a runtime `Hakimi Research State` snapshot from open WorkFrames, attached ContextPacks, scoped evidence refs, open obligations, recent ResearchAction traces, raw primitive-tool escapes, and recent primitive tool lifecycle records. The same snapshot is appended to the stored compaction summary, so automatic compaction preserves the research question and current progress even if the model's free-form summary omits it.
- Post-0.13.0 development has started the AITP-native bridge layer: `packages/agent-core/src/aitp/cli-bridge.ts` can read AITP process graph slices, write AITP exploratory records, and provide a WorkFrame-scoped slice provider. Compiled slices now flow into `ResearchContextPack`, research-context injection, and runtime action bindings, so WorkFrame reminders can carry AITP obligations, source gaps, relation-path brainstorms, and original-question drift checks in the same model turn.

## Development

Requirements are inherited from Kimi Code:

- Node.js `>=24.15.0`
- pnpm `10.33.0`

Build a local installable CLI package from this fork:

```powershell
corepack pnpm --config.engine-strict=false install
corepack pnpm --config.engine-strict=false build
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force dist-pack
corepack pnpm --config.engine-strict=false -C apps/kimi-code pack --pack-destination ..\..\dist-pack
npm install -g .\dist-pack\bhjia-phys-hakimi-0.13.0.tgz
hakimi --version
hakimi
```

For an isolated install check without touching the global npm prefix:

```powershell
$prefix = "$PWD\.sisyphus\drafts\_scratch\hakimi-install-prefix"
npm install --prefix $prefix .\dist-pack\bhjia-phys-hakimi-0.13.0.tgz
& "$prefix\node_modules\.bin\hakimi.cmd" --version
```

## DeepSeek Quick Setup

If the managed Kimi-for-coding endpoint is unavailable for your account, configure DeepSeek as the native default model:

```powershell
hakimi provider deepseek
hakimi provider list
hakimi
```

`hakimi provider deepseek` prompts for your DeepSeek API key when no key is supplied, then writes a normal OpenAI-compatible provider into `~/.hakimi/config.toml`; it does not create a proxy wrapper. For automation you can still pass `--api-key sk-...` or set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`. The default model is `deepseek-v4-pro` at `https://api.deepseek.com`, with `deepseek-v4-flash` available via:

```powershell
hakimi provider deepseek --api-key sk-... --model-id deepseek-v4-flash
```

Pass `--no-thinking` if you want the imported DeepSeek alias to start in non-thinking mode, or `--no-default` if you only want to add the provider without switching the active default model.

When DeepSeek is the active chat model, `WebSearch` no longer depends on a
Kimi OAuth token. Hakimi still prefers the configured Moonshot/Kimi search
service when it is authenticated, but falls back to a no-auth local web search
provider when that service is unavailable.

Hakimi's research runtime starts enabled by default. You do not need to create
domain packs, memory capsules, workflow recipes, or evals before starting a new
topic: open a WorkFrame for the topic and `compile_context_pack`, and Hakimi
will use the built-in `theoretical-physics/general` scaffold until a dedicated
pack exists. New project packs and research-ledger writes use `.hakimi/`
directories such as `.hakimi/research-ledger`, `.hakimi/physics-memory`,
`.hakimi/domain-profiles`, `.hakimi/workflow-recipes`, and `.hakimi/evals`.
Legacy `.aitp/` packs are still scanned read-only for compatibility and can
override the generic fallback for their domain.

When an AITP v5 process graph slice is supplied, Hakimi treats it differently
from legacy pack compatibility: the slice is a canonical AITP-derived
orientation view, so Hakimi compiles it into the current WorkFrame/context and
recommended actions instead of saving it as Hakimi-owned truth. The follow-up
runtime work is to call AITP MCP/CLI at the right moments and write durable
research-process records back through AITP, especially for exploratory records
created during brainstorming, source backtrace, and steering checkpoints. Source
asset records remain AITP-owned: Hakimi may mention `source_asset:<id>` in a
ContextPack, but it should not recreate the raw asset store inside `.hakimi`.

Explicitly disable individual research features only for debugging or upstream
compatibility checks:

```powershell
$env:KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_PHYSICS_MEMORY = "0"
$env:KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_RESEARCH_LEDGER = "0"
$env:KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_RESEARCH_ACTION = "0"
