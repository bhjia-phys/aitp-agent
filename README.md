[Chinese](README.zh-CN.md) | [Upstream Kimi Code docs](https://moonshotai.github.io/kimi-code/en/)

AITP Agent is a research-agent runtime project for theoretical physics. It starts from the Kimi Code CLI codebase and aims to make physics memory, knowledge compilation, research actions, validation, benchmark evidence, replay, and failure feedback first-class parts of the agent runtime.

This repository is currently an early-stage fork of [MoonshotAI/kimi-code](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code). The default product behavior still follows Kimi Code unless an AITP experimental flag explicitly enables a new runtime feature. The completed first slices are tracked in [AITP Agent 0.0.1 Implementation Plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-30-aitp-agent-0.0.1.md) and [AITP Agent 0.0.2 Research Ledger And ActionAlgebra Implementation Plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-01-aitp-agent-0.0.2-research-ledger-actionalgebra.md). The original cross-slice roadmap is preserved in [AITP Agent Runtime Roadmap Implementation Plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-02-aitp-agent-runtime-roadmap.md) and [AITP Agent Next Slices And Upstream Sync Implementation Plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-02-aitp-agent-next-slices-and-upstream-sync.md), while the current post-0.2.5 execution baseline is now tracked in [AITP Agent Runtime Slices V2 Implementation Plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-02-aitp-agent-runtime-slices-v2.md).

## Why This Exists

The goal is not to wrap a coding agent with a research notebook or a large prompt. AITP Agent should be able to participate in theoretical-physics research as a runtime-native system:

- load domain-scoped physics memory progressively during a session;
- compile notes, papers, derivations, code mappings, benchmarks, and failures into typed graph objects;
- expose compact context packs instead of dumping the whole knowledge base into the prompt;
- keep research domains isolated unless an explicit bridge allows cross-domain context;
- run fine-grained research actions such as convention checks, dimensional checks, formula-to-code mapping, benchmark execution, and failure analysis;
- record action traces so the harness and the research workflow can improve from mistakes.

## Architecture Direction

AITP Agent is planned around five runtime layers.

### Skills

Procedural memory: how the agent should work. Examples include formula-to-code debugging, derive-then-check workflows, benchmark-from-failure workflows, and LibRPA run preparation.

### Physics Memory Capsules

Semantic memory: what is known, with scope, assumptions, provenance, dependency edges, reliability state, and expansion handles into the underlying graph. Capsules are intentionally coarser than graph atoms and are meant to be progressively disclosed.

### Research Ledger

Source-backed research events: what actually happened in a session before it is trusted as reusable physics memory. The ledger records papers, web excerpts, derivation scratch, equations, code observations, git diffs, benchmark observations, failures, tool runs, and user decisions in a deterministic, compile-ready layout.

### Compiler

The compiler turns raw sources, topic notes, derivations, code traces, benchmark outputs, and failures into typed graph objects and context packs. Compilation is not summarization: it preserves dependencies, scope, contradiction markers, validation status, and failure conditions.

### Research Actions

Research actions are fine-grained, auditable work units over the physics graph and the local tool environment. They are lower-level than "use an MCP server" and higher-level than raw shell commands. Examples:

- `graph.expand_capsule`
- `graph.trace_dependency_closure`
- `derive.check_dimension_consistency`
- `validate.check_convention`
- `code.map_formula_to_code_region`
- `code.compare_git_diff_to_mapping`
- `benchmark.run_minimal_case`
- `memory.propose_failure_mode`
- `harness.build_eval_from_failure`

The universal action layer is intentionally domain-neutral. Domain-specific intent is attached through structured `ResearchActionBinding` records with `domainId`, `workflowId`, `lensId`, `checkId`, `adapterId`, and scoped params.

### WorkFrames, Obligations, And Harness

`WorkFrame` is the active research problem state: domain, topic, goal, active objects, assumptions, conventions, context pack, and trust state. Research actions create obligations such as source support, dimensional consistency, convention consistency, known-limit checks, formula-code mapping, and benchmark validation. Blocking obligations should prevent validated promotion and can become harness candidates when they fail or remain inconclusive.

## Relationship To Other Agent Runtimes

### Kimi Code

Kimi Code is the implementation baseline. It already provides the TypeScript monorepo, terminal agent runtime, model/tool loop, skills, MCP, subagents, sessions, records/replay, compaction, permissions, and lifecycle hooks. AITP Agent should extend this runtime rather than sit outside it.

### Codex

Codex is a reference for tool engineering. The most relevant ideas to migrate are explicit tool exposure levels, stable pre/post tool-use payloads, structured tool outputs, tool-call source tracking, deferred tool discovery, and action traces suitable for harness analysis.

### ForgeCode

ForgeCode is a reference for harness and evaluation design: explicit agent definitions, tool boundaries, benchmark cases, and repeatable eval-style workflows.

## Version Plan

### 0.0.1: Physics Memory Vertical Slice

Build the first runtime-native memory path inside `packages/agent-core`:

- add `physics-memory` types, parser, scanner, registry, compiler, and exports;
- add a model-invocable `PhysicsMemory` builtin tool;
- support `list_domains`, `list_capsules`, `load_capsule`, and `compile_context`;
- keep physics memory parallel to skills rather than embedding it inside skills;
- gate the feature behind an experimental flag;
- prove the shape with a narrow LibRPA fixture set.

The 0.0.1 schema should already reserve fields for graph references, expansion handles, required checks, and action affordances so the later research-action layer has a stable target.

### 0.0.2: Research Ledger And ActionAlgebra

- add a `research-ledger` subsystem that scans `.aitp/research-ledger` and stores source-backed research events separately from trusted physics memory;
- add compile proposals from ledger events into candidate capsules, graph refs, obligations, and harness candidates;
- extend `ResearchActionRegistry` into an ActionAlgebra with phases, preconditions, effects, generated obligations, validators, and primitive tool attribution;
- add `WorkFrame`, `ResearchObligation`, and `ValidationScheduler` foundations;
- expose `ResearchLedger` and `ResearchAction` model tools behind experimental flags;
- coordinate Kimi primitive tools, Codex-style lifecycle ideas, and ForgeCode-style harness boundaries without replacing Kimi's tool manager.

### 0.0.3: Thin Base Runtime Spine

Add the smallest Codex-inspired reliability layer needed for AITP capture:

- primitive tool lifecycle envelopes;
- action/workframe attribution for tool calls;
- result status and artifact refs;
- diff/output capture boundaries;
- interruption/background awareness where needed.

This slice should not port Codex or rewrite Kimi's tool manager.

### 0.0.4: LedgerWriter And Controlled Capture

- add schema-checked `ResearchLedger.write_event`;
- write deterministic `.aitp/research-ledger/<topic>/events/*.md` files;
- capture only high-value source, git diff, benchmark, and failure observations at first;
- keep long outputs as artifact refs instead of ledger noise.

### 0.0.5: WorkFrame And ResearchAction Call Trace

- make WorkFrame an active session context;
- support opening, switching, listing, and closing WorkFrames;
- connect ResearchAction calls to primitive tool calls and ledger events;
- generate obligations from action effects;
- preserve domain isolation across simultaneous research frames.

### 0.0.6: LibRPA Micro Vertical Slice

Prove the runtime spine on a narrow computational-physics workflow:

```text
formula capsule
-> code mapping
-> git diff / implementation trace
-> smoke benchmark
-> intermediate observable check
-> failure mode or validated memory update
-> harness regression case
```

### 0.0.7: Capsule Boundary Compiler

- compile locally self-consistent derivation/code blocks into candidate capsules;
- keep micro reasoning lightweight;
- use capsule boundaries only when local blocks connect to memory, graph, final answers, or other blocks.

### 0.0.8: PhysicsDirectionEngine And Lenses

- add applicability-gated physics lenses rather than keyword triggers;
- start with `topological-order/fqhe-cs` and `librpa/head-wing` domain packs;
- include a charge-flux quantization lens that distinguishes external electromagnetic flux, emergent Chern-Simons flux, and quasiparticle AB flux periods.

### 0.0.9: EscalationPolicy And Final Gate

- keep simple questions light;
- escalate code edits, benchmark work, promotion, and high-risk theory claims;
- prevent final answers from claiming validated status while blocking obligations remain open.

### 0.1: Harness And Eval Runner

- convert failed or inconclusive action traces into reviewable harness candidates;
- promote confirmed candidates into deterministic eval cases;
- add end-to-end evals for FQHE/CS reasoning and LibRPA head-wing workflows.

### 0.2: FQHE/CS Theory Vertical Slice

Close the first formal-theory loop with capsules, derivation blocks, physics lenses, convention checks, and final-answer status around Laughlin wavefunctions, flux insertion, charge-flux quantization, Chern-Simons effective theory, and K-matrix response.

## Current Status

- Upstream parity with `MoonshotAI/kimi-code:main` was checked on 2026-06-01; the fork was identical at commit `933cf67`.
- The AITP Agent 0.0.1 physics-memory vertical slice is implemented behind `KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_PHYSICS_MEMORY=1`.
- `packages/agent-core` now includes physics-memory types, parser, scanner, registry, compiler, session scanning, append-only records, a model-invocable `PhysicsMemory` builtin tool, LibRPA fixture capsules, and a foundational `ResearchActionRegistry`.
- Windows baseline failures in the broader `agent-core` suite have been resolved; see [AITP Agent 0.0.1 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.1-audit.md).
- The 0.0.2 foundation is implemented: `research-ledger` types/parser/scanner/registry/compiler, session scanning, append-only records, `ResearchLedger` tool, ActionAlgebra types, default research actions, scheduler, `ResearchAction` tool, raw-tool escape records, and harness candidate conversion. See [AITP Agent 0.0.2 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.2-audit.md).
- 0.0.3 has started with the thin primitive tool lifecycle spine: real loop-level tool calls now emit `tool_lifecycle.started` and `tool_lifecycle.completed` records with status, bounded summaries, timing, cwd, and future WorkFrame/ResearchAction attribution slots. See [AITP Agent 0.0.3 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.3-audit.md).
- 0.0.4 has started with schema-checked `ResearchLedger.write_event` and controlled `capture_event`: compact source-backed events can be written to deterministic `.aitp/research-ledger/<topic>/events/*.md` paths, registered immediately, audited through `research_ledger.event_written`, and filtered through source/git-diff/benchmark/failure capture policy. See [AITP Agent 0.0.4 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.4-audit.md).
- 0.0.5 has started with active WorkFrame runtime state and ResearchAction call trace: `ResearchAction` can open/switch/list/close WorkFrames, start/finish action calls, replay both, attach ledger event ids to action results, and primitive tool lifecycle records now carry active `workFrameId` and `actionCallId`. See [AITP Agent 0.0.5 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.5-audit.md).
- 0.0.6 has started with a LibRPA head-wing micro vertical slice: universal code/benchmark actions bound to LibRPA workflow intent, a CI-safe head-wing smoke benchmark stand-in, scheduler expectations, controlled failure capture, and harness candidate conversion. See [AITP Agent 0.0.6 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.6-audit.md).
- 0.0.7 has started with a capsule boundary compiler: locally self-contained `ResearchBlock` objects can compile into unpromoted `PhysicsCapsule` candidates with assumptions, conventions, source refs, open questions, and required checks preserved. See [AITP Agent 0.0.7 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.7-audit.md).
- 0.0.8 has started with PhysicsDirectionEngine and applicability-gated lenses: FQHE/CS charge-flux quantization and LibRPA head-wing formula-code mapping can now be recommended, rejected, and audited with caveats, guiding questions, required checks, and structured ResearchAction bindings. See [AITP Agent 0.0.8 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.8-audit.md).
- 0.0.9 has started with EscalationPolicy and Final Gate: simple physics questions remain lightweight, code/benchmark/high-risk theory/promotion work escalates into required runtime controls, and validated final claims are downgraded or blocked while blocking obligations remain open. See [AITP Agent 0.0.9 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.0.9-audit.md).
- 0.1 has started with Harness and Eval Runner: failed/inconclusive action traces can become deterministic eval cases, and eval runs can check action sequence, action outcomes, evidence refs, and required checks. See [AITP Agent 0.1 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.1-audit.md).
- 0.2 has started with an executable FQHE/CS theory vertical slice: Laughlin wavefunction, flux insertion, Abelian CS action, and K-matrix response blocks compile into candidate capsules, pass through charge-flux lens/convention checks, produce an eval case, and reach the final gate. See [AITP Agent 0.2 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2-audit.md).
- 0.2.1 upstream sync guardrail has configured a local `upstream` remote for Kimi Code; a later retry successfully merged `upstream/main` at `7ffb5dd` while preserving AITP runtime extensions. See [Upstream Sync 2026-06-02](docs/internal/upstream-sync-2026-06-02.md).
- 0.2.2 has refactored research actions toward universal ids plus structured `ResearchActionBinding`: FQHE/CS charge-flux checks now bind `validate.check_convention` with a charge-flux `checkId`, and LibRPA head-wing benchmark work now binds `benchmark.run_minimal_case` with a LibRPA adapter id. See [AITP Agent 0.2.2 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2.2-audit.md).
- 0.2.3 has added file-backed `DomainProfile` and `WorkflowRecipe` registries behind `KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_DOMAIN_PROFILE` and `KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_WORKFLOW_RECIPE`, scanning `.aitp/domain-profiles` and `.aitp/workflow-recipes` into `agent.domainProfiles` and `agent.workflowRecipes`. See [AITP Agent 0.2.3 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2.3-audit.md).
- 0.2.5 has added the first WorkFrame ContextPack orchestrator: active WorkFrames can compile bounded `ResearchContextPack` summaries from DomainProfile, WorkflowRecipe, PhysicsMemory, ResearchLedger, and action bindings, then attach the pack id back to the WorkFrame for replay and audit. See [AITP Agent 0.2.5 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2.5-audit.md).
- 0.2.6 has started closing the turn loop: prompt-sensitive WorkFrame reuse/switching now runs inside the injection cycle, bounded `ResearchContextPack` summaries can be recompiled for the inferred active frame, and a compact AITP research-context reminder can enter the model-facing context before a research step. See [AITP Agent 0.2.6 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2.6-audit.md).
- 0.2.7 has started dynamic tool exposure: once a research turn has a bounded `ResearchContextPack`, the runtime can apply a temporary managed-tool overlay so theory-oriented turns keep semantic research tools visible while code-oriented turns can additionally expose `Bash` / `Write` / `Edit`. See [AITP Agent 0.2.7 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2.7-audit.md).
- 0.2.8 has started controlled auto-capture from real work: `tool_lifecycle.completed` can now classify real tool outcomes against the active `WorkFrame`, write compact git-diff / benchmark / failure / source-excerpt evidence into `.aitp/research-ledger`, and record explicit skip reasons for low-value tool noise. See [AITP Agent 0.2.8 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2.8-audit.md).
- 0.2.9 has started graph-aware memory compilation: ledger events can now compile into typed graph candidates with provenance checks, dependency diagnostics, assumption traces, and contradiction warnings for incompatible conventions. These outputs remain candidate-level rather than silently becoming canonical memory. See [AITP Agent 0.2.9 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.2.9-audit.md).
- 0.3.0 has started the promotion pipeline and trust-ladder gate: graph candidates can now be promoted only through an explicit `PhysicsPromotionPacket` with source refs, scope, validation refs, and formalization checkpoint requirements enforced. Promoted capsules keep trust metadata instead of discarding the promotion path. See [AITP Agent 0.3.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.3.0-audit.md).
- 0.3.1 has started final-gate lifecycle integration: when a research turn tries to end while the active `WorkFrame` still fails the final gate, the runtime now injects one concise final-gate continuation message and forces one more model step so the answer can downgrade itself instead of quietly overclaiming completion. See [AITP Agent 0.3.1 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.3.1-audit.md).
- 0.4.0 has started Harness V2: file-backed research eval cases under `.aitp/evals` can now parse into `ResearchEvalCase`, load through `agent.researchHarness` behind `KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_RESEARCH_HARNESS=1`, check action bindings/evidence/final status/forbidden claims, and write failed or inconclusive harness candidates back as deterministic eval files. This slice also scopes final-gate evidence to the active WorkFrame so unrelated prior evidence cannot satisfy validated status. See [AITP Agent 0.4.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.4.0-audit.md).
- 0.5.0 has started the real LibRPA file-backed vertical: `adapter.librpa.head-wing-smoke` is now a first-class benchmark adapter contract, and the repo includes LibRPA `.aitp` domain profile, workflow recipe, physics-memory capsules, and eval fixtures that load through an isolated session and close the context/eval/final-gate loop. See [AITP Agent 0.5.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.5.0-audit.md).
- 0.6.0 has started the FQHE/CS V2 file-backed theory vertical: Laughlin wavefunction, flux insertion, Abelian CS response, K-matrix response, known-limit checks, and flux-identity failure modes now live in `.aitp` fixtures and pass isolated-session context/eval tests without LibRPA leakage. See [AITP Agent 0.6.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.6.0-audit.md).
- 0.7.0 has started bridge-gated multi-domain isolation: `Bridge` capsules can now explicitly authorize named cross-domain capsules, default FQHE/LibRPA context packs stay separate, and `bridgePolicy: deny` records cross-domain denial diagnostics. See [AITP Agent 0.7.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.7.0-audit.md).
- 0.8.0 has started the graph kernel and query semantics lane: `physics-graph` can build a graph from physics memory, expand neighborhoods and dependency closure, run bridge-policy-aware path search, and query contradiction edges. See [AITP Agent 0.8.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.8.0-audit.md).
- 0.9.0 has started the formalization bridge: `formalization` can identify definitions, assumptions, formulas, lemmas, and theorem-like graph nodes as conservative formalization contracts and export a blueprint-like dependency graph without claiming proof-assistant verification. See [AITP Agent 0.9.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.9.0-audit.md).
- 0.10.0 has started closing the executor gap: `ResearchAction` can now run registered in-process benchmark adapters, physics-graph queries, and formalization-blueprint exports directly through the model-facing tool while preserving primitive shell/git/web attribution boundaries. Harness eval writeback can also namespace candidate eval files by session id so parallel sessions do not collide on the same failure trace. See [AITP Agent 0.10.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.10.0-audit.md).
- 0.11.0 has started primitive tool plan templates and live native-tool orchestration: every default `ResearchAction` can now render an auditable native-tool plan, with first-class actions for literature search, scoped patch preparation, and external benchmark job submission. Runtime tool exposure now reads action bindings, activates the native Kimi tools required by those templates through a turn-scoped Kimi tool builder, and replays topic-scoped overlays/evidence attribution without cross-session leakage while `ResearchAction` still does not execute shell, git, web, MCP, or HPC work itself. The live turn coverage now exercises source search, code patching, and external job submission through native `WebSearch`/`FetchURL`, `Read`/`Edit`, `Bash`, and `ResearchLedger.capture_event` call attribution, writes durable source/code/job event files, emits `research_ledger.event_written`, and feeds `ledger:event...` ids back into `ResearchAction.finish_action_call.evidence_refs`. See [AITP Agent 0.11.0 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.11.0-audit.md).
- 0.11.1 has added the first external job submission adapter contract: `adapter.external.job-submission` normalizes scheduler/MCP/HPC/manual job receipts into `BenchmarkAdapterRunResult` for `benchmark.submit_external_job` without executing the scheduler inside `ResearchAction`. Primitive plans now include an adapter-normalization step after native submission and before ledger/action recording. See [AITP Agent 0.11.1 Audit](docs/internal/aitp-agent-0.11.1-audit.md).
- The runtime roadmap through 0.11.1 is now implemented as a file-backed, graph-aware, bridge-gated, audited baseline with deterministic research executors for the graph, benchmark, formalization, and external-job receipt lanes plus native-tool orchestration for literature, code, and external benchmark workflows. These native workflows now have both primitive tool call attribution and durable ledger evidence references.
